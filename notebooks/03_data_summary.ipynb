    "\n",
    "2.  **Prioritize Core Functional Excellence:** Features like **Timetable/Schedule (FR1)**, **Academic Results (FR2)**, and **Fee Payments (FR4)** are universally demanded. They must be robust, reliable, and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Enhance User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):** While `NFR2 - UI Modernization` might not have been the top issue in the provided NFR heatmap (due to data used for that specific image), the full report consistently emphasizes UI/UX improvements. This includes better navigation and a modern look and feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Improve Mobile Experience:** Both Frustrated Users and Power Users report issues with mobile usability. A responsive and intuitive mobile interface is no longer a luxury but an expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Investigate 'Unknown' Segment:** The significant size of the 'Unknown' segment (42.9%) warrants further qualitative or quantitative investigation to understand their unique needs and behaviors if they are not being adequately captured by current segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Leverage 'Power Users':** This satisfied and engaged group can be a source for beta testing new features, providing detailed feedback, and acting as champions for iZone.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Focus on Reliability and Performance:** Across multiple NFRs (Performance, Feature Reliability), it's clear that iZone needs to be faster and more dependable. Frequent errors or slow loading times are major detractors from user satisfaction."

    "## 7. Conclusion\n",

    "This user segmentation and requirements analysis provides a clear, data-driven path forward for enhancing the iZone platform. By focusing on the needs of distinct user segments, particularly the large 'Frustrated Users' group, and by prioritizing improvements in core functionalities, performance, and usability, we can significantly improve user satisfaction and the overall effectiveness of iZone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps could include:**\n",
    "-   Developing detailed user stories and feature specifications based on these findings.\n",
    "-   Conducting targeted usability testing for high-priority NFRs (e.g., mobile experience, navigation).\n",
    "-   Planning a phased rollout of improvements, starting with those impacting the largest and most dissatisfied segments.\n",
    "-   Continuously monitoring user feedback and platform analytics to measure the impact of changes."
